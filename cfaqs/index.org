I provide Korean translation of C Programming FAQ,
the official FAQ from Usenet =comp.lang.c=
which is written by [[http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/][Steve Summit]].

Thanks for his permission, I was able to translate this document in 
Korean.  If you need any copyright information about my translation, 
read a few front pages of the document.
        
This document is somewhat different than the original on-line 
C FAQ list. Here are some plans and it's features:

- All answers will have appropriate references regarding to C99.
  (See the Reference Chapter for [HS2002], [C99], [ISO Rationale],
  and [SUS].)
- More extended examples are included  (Additional materials are explicitly marked to avoid confusion)

* Files

  Unfortunately, these files are far from printing quality.
  Currently, I'm concentrating the contents itself, not design nor layout
  problem.

  Unlike the old version, the HTML pages are encoded in UTF-8, not euc-kr.

  Sorry for your inconvinience, but Postscript version is no longer
  provided.  The good news is that new PDF version is searchable!
