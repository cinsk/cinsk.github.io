Recently, I bought a macbook pro for my personal use.
As soon as it is delivered to my home, I installed Emacs 24.x, from
[[http://emacsformacosx.com/][EmacsForMacOsX]].  Normally, in my other computers, I use the version
23.x.  The reason that I installed unstable 24.x is, that I want to
use the package system (package.el) in my macbook.  It would be very
boring and tedious if I need to install all the packages that I want
to use like in my other Gentoo linux.

For my Linux systems, I uses Korean and English fonts using Emacs's
X resource configuration.  For example,

#+BEGIN_SRC conf-xdefault-mode
Emacs*Fontset-0:-*-DejaVu Sans Mono-*-*-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-fontset-dejavu14,\
          latin:-*-DejaVu Sans Mono-*-*-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*,\
        hangul:-*-NanumGothic_Coding-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
Emacs.Font: fontset-dejavu14
#+END_SRC

But in my macbook, it didn't work. The reason is, in Mac, the X
window system is not running by default. It seems that MacOS delays
loading X window system until the first X application starts. And it
takes a couple of seconds, which I don't like it. Of course, I could
force to load the X resource, by using =xrdb -merge
MY_EMACS_X_RESOURCE_FILE= in my =.bash_profile= but as I said
before, it took several seconds to load the X system.

So, I want to set my fontset configuration in the startup lisp code
instead X resource file. With a few experiments, here are the
working version:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (set-fontset-font "fontset-standard" 'unicode 
                    (font-spec :name "Consolas"
                               :weight 'normal
                               :slant 'normal
                               :size 16)); nil 'prepend)
  (set-fontset-font "fontset-standard" 'hangul
                    (font-spec :name "NanumGothicCoding"))

  (set-face-font 'default "fontset-standard")
#+END_SRC

In addition to fontset configuration, there are a few more configuration for Mac.

1. I want to use Command key as a meta key, since it's where the
   Meta key should be.
2. I want to use Command-C to work as "copy the content to the
   clipboard".  Since the Command key is meta key now, I want to
   bind M-c to something that works like "copy the selection to the
   clipboard for other application.".
3. I want to make Fn-Delete key as to delete right character.
4. I want to maintain one startup lisp code for all my Linux
   machines and Macbook.

With some help, here's the complete lisp code for Mac:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(when (eq system-type 'darwin)
  (setq mac-option-modifier nil)
  (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)
  ;; sets fn-delete to be right-delete
  (global-set-key [kp-delete] 'delete-char)

  (set-fontset-font "fontset-standard" 'unicode 
                    (font-spec :name "Consolas"
                               :weight 'normal
                               :slant 'normal
                               :size 16)); nil 'prepend)
  (set-fontset-font "fontset-standard" 'hangul
                    (font-spec :name "NanumGothicCoding"))

  (set-face-font 'default "fontset-standard")

  (when (display-graphic-p)
    (global-set-key [(meta ?c)] 'ns-copy-including-secondary)))
#+END_SRC

Finally! I can use Emacs with my custom preferences like in my Linux
machines. :)

Note that this configuration worked on Emacs pretest binary 24.x
EmacsForMacOsX. As 24.1 is turned to the stable release, it suddenly
turned out not working! :(  Read on more [[../../../2012/07/10/osx-emacs-fontset.html][here]].
