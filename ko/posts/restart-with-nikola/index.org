More than 2 years, I haven't updated my site.  To say long story
short, I was in UK for more than one years, and unable to set up my
desktop machine, which has all the sources of my site, left in a
luggage during in UK.  Recently, I moved to the Bay area in US, and
finally set up the old desktop again, and replace the site generator
from [[https://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]] to [[https://getnikola.com/][Nikola]].

/Jekyll/ was great, however, it requires too many modification for my
need, since my site requires some static pages plus blog entries, and
I wrote all my posts in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]], which was not supported by /Jekyll/
so I had to come up with my own solution that convert =.org= files
to =.html= files using Emacs myself, and insert YAML configuration to
all of them, and uses /Jekyll/ to generate the final output.

Now, I read a very interesting article, [[https://streakycobra.github.io/posts/blogging-in-org-mode-with-nikola/][Blogging in org-mode with
Nikola]], which introduced /Nikola/ to me, and I decided to experiment
with it.  After few hours of experimentation, I was really surprised
as it contains everything that I imagined before!

- /org mode/ support using Emacs instead of custom converter.
- RSS feed by default
- support for non-blog site
- [[https://disqus.com/][Disqus]] integration.
- support for multi-lingual site

I dare to say, (for my own need at least), /Nikola/ is better than
vanilla /Jekyll/, and still better than [[http://octopress.org/][Octopress]].

Of course, there are some problems that I found already, but they are
minor enough.  Hopefully, I may explain those in another post.

Anyway, here I am, restarted the blog again.  Hope that I can find
many interesting topics soon.
