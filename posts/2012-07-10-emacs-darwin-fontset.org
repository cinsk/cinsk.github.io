Whenever I installed new Emacs version, the init script for fontset
turned out not working.  It is sad that even now Emacs fontset related API is somewhat
unstable. I cannot blame Emacs developers for this. Part of the
reason is there are so many bad font (esp. Korean font) which works
very poorly on non-Windows machines.

Anyway, the script in [[/posts/emacs-smart-ediff/index.html][my previous post]] does not work with the stable
24.1 binary from [[http://emacsformacosx.com/][EmacsForMacOsX]].

Here are working version of Emacs snippet that uses different font
for multiple charset:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(when (eq system-type 'darwin)
  ;; These configuration seems to work in
  ;; GNU Emacs 24.1.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin, NS apple-appkit-1038.36)
  ;; of 2012-06-11 on bob.porkrind.org

  ;; default font family
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Consolas")

  ;; default font size
  ;;
  ;; WARNING: depending on the default font, some height value may
  ;; cause a broken frame display; that is, the beginning of the 
  ;; buffer is not visible.
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :height 165)

  ;; You may add :size POINT in below font-spec if you want to use
  ;; specific size of Hangul font regardless of default font size
  (set-fontset-font t 'hangul
                    (font-spec :name "NanumGothicCoding")))
#+END_SRC

Height 165 seems to work well with "Consolas" font.

Yes! The height is 165 (about 16 pt). As I'm growing old, I cannot
use smaller font size any more. It sucks! Anyway, here is the
screenshot with the above setting:

#+ATTR_HTML: class="img-rounded" width="50%" alt="OSX Mountain Lion Emacs with Korean Font"

I tried with several fonts such as Monaco, Andale Mono, and so on
but I found Consolas is superior among others (this is my biased
opinion, of course.)
