#+END_COMMENT

On emacs ruby-mode, if you do =M-x run-ruby= (or
=C-c C-s=), the inferior ruby interpreter is provided in
the "=*ruby*=" buffer so that you can evaluate lots of ruby
statements or expressions.

When you press =M-p= (=M-x comint-previous-input=), Emacs will cycle to
the previous input histrory saving input, so that you can easily
re-evaulate of your previous input.

It works like other inferior interpreter provided by python-mode,
slime, and so on.

What makes me frustrated is, it works for the ruby 1.8 installed in
my gentoo system, but it does not work for the ruby 1.9.3 installed
via RVM. The minibuffer shows sulpurous error:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
Search failed: "^irb(.*)[0-9:]+0> *"
#+END_SRC

Looking at the ruby-mode's source, I found that string is the value
of '=inferior-ruby-first-prompt-pattern=' in =inf-ruby.el=. It looks
like that ruby-mode uses =inferior-ruby-first-prompt-pattern= and
=inferior-ruby-prompt-pattern= for the ruby's prompt pattern.

Another notable different from the start between two rubies (v1.8
system versus v1.9 RVM) are their prompt patterns:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
  # ruby 1.8 (system)
  irb(main):001:0> _

  # ruby 1.9.3 (RVM)
  ruby-1.9.2-p180 :001 > _
#+END_SRC

Now it's clear who is the culprit. Due to the difference of the
prompt pattern, ruby-mode could not provide me =M-p= or =M-n= working.

So I modified two variables in =inf-ruby.el= and reports a bug to the
Ruby issue tracking system and got a quick response.

It turns out that it's not the fault of ruby-mode, but it's the
fault of RVM. (Actually, it's not a defect. It just not right for my
purpose.)

By default, RVM uses different prompt from the native ruby. To solve
this, you can force RVM ruby (irb) to use the native prompt
pattern. It's simple: modify =$HOME/.irbrc= to include following:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
IRB.conf[:PROMPT_MODE] = :DEFAULT
#+END_SRC

I feel embbarassed that I blamed ruby-mode when I found something is
wrong :(
