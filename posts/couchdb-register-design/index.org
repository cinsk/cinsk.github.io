Whenever I experiment CouchDB, especially design documents, always I
feel unhandy to upload the document.

For simple experiments, Futon (CouchDB web interface) is the easiest
solution. However, if you want to keep the changes systemically, or
if you want to use any version control system, you're on your own.

The difficulty come from the format of the design document; CouchDB
wants you to specify javascript functions in JSON string. If you
decided not to use Futon, you'll escape your function in JSON string
by yourself.

Worse, if your function is not valid, you'll realize after the
design document is uploaded.

Precisely, I want a tool that:

  - can add/update the design document from the sources that I provided,
  - can verify all javascript functions before uploading,
  - can upload attachment files.
    
First, I tried to use CouchApp, but lack of the detailed guide makes
me gave up. Sorry CouchApp folks. :(

Second, I wrote simple bash shell scripts to interact with CouchDB
with =curl(1)=, to upload the document after escaping the function to
build JSON document. It was not simple to implement all the features
that I need, so I stopped.

Third, I try to write the tool in Ruby, and try to use httpclient,
but I couldn't make httpclient works for HTTP client features like
multipart/form-data. (Mayhaps I didn't know how to use httpclient
fluently.) So I stopped again.

Fourth, I realized that I spent too much time to write this
script. I don't want to dig the source of the httpclient, so I just
write small Ruby wrapper of =curl(1)=, and made the tool, finally.

If you have interest, visit couch-register-design and experiment.
